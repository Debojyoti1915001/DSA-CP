// https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/

/*
You are given an array of integers stones
where stones[i] is the weight of the ith stone.
We are playing a game with the stones.
On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together.
Suppose the stones have weights x and y with x <= y.
The result of this smash is:
If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed,
and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone.
If there are no stones left, return 0.
Example 1:
Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can combine 2 and 4 to get 2, so the array converts to [2,7,1,8,1] then,
we can combine 7 and 8 to get 1, so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
we can combine 2 and 1 to get 1, so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
we can combine 1 and 1 to get 0, so the array converts to [1], then that's the optimal value.

/**
This question eaquals to partition an array into 2 subsets whose difference is minimal
(1) S1 + S2  = S
(2) S1 - S2 = diff  
==> -> diff = S - 2 * S2  ==> minimize diff equals to  maximize S2 
Now we should find the maximum of S2 , range from 0 to S / 2, using dp can solve this
dp[i][j] = {true if some subset from 1st to j'th has a sum equal to sum i, false otherwise}
    i ranges from (sum of all elements) {1..n}
    j ranges from  {1..n}
same as 494. Target Sum
