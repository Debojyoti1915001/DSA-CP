// https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-product-of-word-lengths/

/*
Given a string array words, return the maximum value of
length(word[i]) * length(word[j]) where the two words do not share common letters.
If no such two words exist, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: words = ["abcw","baz","foo","bar","xtfn","abcdef"]
Output: 16
Explanation: The two words can be "abcw", "xtfn".
