Talking about Preorder, Postorder and Inorder Traversals :

We can construct a Binary Tree from any one traversal only but we cannot construct an unique Binary Tree from a single traversal because we do not have the complete information.
We can construct an Unique Binary Tree given any two traversals of the Binary Tree.
In case of Binary Search Tree (BST) , the Inorder traversal always prints the nodes in ascending order.
We can construct an Unique BST given the Preorder or Postorder of BST(because Inorder is known to us).
